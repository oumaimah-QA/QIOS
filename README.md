## What is QIOS?

QIOS is a structured collection of **AI skills** for software testing. Each skill is a focused, versioned QA module loaded before an agent answers a testing request.

Rather than rebuilding QA context in every prompt, QIOS applies the relevant standards, coverage rules, and output structure automatically. The result is consistent, risk-aware, and reusable QA output across sessions.

> QIOS standardizes how QA reasoning is applied — not how prompts are written.
>
> **Works with:** Claude · Codex · Cursor · Any LLM with system instructions

---

## Why QIOS?

QIOS makes QA reasoning reusable, structured, and repeatable across sessions and projects. Standard prompting can produce useful answers, but it does not preserve QA structure, coverage discipline, or output consistency by default.

| Without QIOS | With QIOS |
|---|---|
| Re-explain QA context in every session | Agent keeps QA context, standards, and structure available |
| Outputs vary from one prompt to another | Outputs stay structured, repeatable, and risk-tagged |
| Test coverage is assembled manually | Happy path, negative, edge, and security coverage are generated systematically |
| Edge cases are easy to miss | Edge cases are explicitly built into the workflow |
| Knowledge is lost between sessions | QA knowledge is versioned in Git and shared across projects |

---

## Approach

QIOS treats QA as a structured engineering discipline rather than a prompt-based activity.  
Each skill encodes coverage logic, risk awareness, and output standards so the agent operates within a consistent QA framework and produces reusable deliverables.

---

## How it works

QIOS uses a selective loading model: the agent reads skill metadata first, selects the best match, then loads only the detailed instructions it needs.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B{AI reads skill metadata\nname + description}
    B --> C{Select matching skill}
    C --> D[api-deep-analyzer]
    C --> E[api-spec-generator]
    C --> F[qa-test-designer]
    C --> G[gherkin-spec-writer]
    C --> H[cypress-test-bootstrap]
    C --> I[playwright-test-bootstrap]
    D & E & F & G & H & I --> J[Load full SKILL.md\n+ references]
    J --> K[Structured QA Output\ntest cases · collections · .feature · specs]
```

---

## Skills

Each skill covers a distinct QA task and is selected from request intent.

| Skill | Purpose | Trigger phrases |
|---|---|---|
| [`api-deep-analyzer`](skills/api-deep-analyzer/) | Generate complete API test coverage from an endpoint or spec | *"analyze this API", "test cases for this endpoint"* |
| [`api-spec-generator`](skills/api-spec-generator/) | Generate importable Postman and Bruno collections | *"generate Postman collection", "Bruno spec"* |
| [`qa-test-designer`](skills/qa-test-designer/) | Build a structured test plan from a User Story or Jira ticket | *"test cases for this US", "test plan"* |
| [`gherkin-spec-writer`](skills/gherkin-spec-writer/) | Convert requirements into BDD `.feature` files | *"write Gherkin", "generate .feature file"* |
| [`cypress-test-bootstrap`](skills/cypress-test-bootstrap/) | Scaffold Cypress automation projects and reusable E2E specs | *"init Cypress", "scaffold E2E tests"* |
| [`playwright-test-bootstrap`](skills/playwright-test-bootstrap/) | Scaffold Playwright automation projects and reusable E2E specs | *"init Playwright", "scaffold Playwright tests"* |

## Quick Start

Choose the installation mode that matches your usage: globally for your agent, or locally within a single repository.

### Install globally — Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oumaimah-QA/QIOS
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -r QIOS/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/
cp QIOS/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

### Install — Claude Projects

1. Open your Claude Project → **Project Instructions**
2. Paste the full content of `AGENTS.md`
3. For each skill you want available, paste its `SKILL.md` content

### Install — Per project

```bash
mkdir -p ./.codex/skills
cp -r QIOS/skills/* ./.codex/skills/
cp QIOS/AGENTS.md ./.codex/AGENTS.md
```

### Use

Describe the QA task in natural language. QIOS maps the request to the appropriate skill automatically.

```text
"Analyze POST /payment/transfer and generate all test cases"
# → triggers api-deep-analyzer

"Generate a Postman collection from this Swagger spec"
# → triggers api-spec-generator

"Write test cases for this user story: [paste US]"
# → triggers qa-test-designer

"Generate the .feature file for this feature"
# → triggers gherkin-spec-writer

"Scaffold a Cypress project for the wallet module"
# → triggers cypress-test-bootstrap

"Scaffold a Playwright project for the wallet module"
# → triggers playwright-test-bootstrap
```

---

## Compatibility

QIOS is agent-agnostic because its core assets are plain-text instructions, structured references, and reusable examples.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Q[QIOS Skills] --> A[Claude\nProject Instructions]
    Q --> B[Codex\n~/.codex/skills/]
    Q --> C[Cursor\n.cursorrules]
    Q --> D[Any LLM\nSystem Instructions]
```

| Agent | Installation method |
|---|---|
| **Claude** | Project Instructions or system instructions |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/skills/` — auto-loaded |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` + SKILL.md content |
| **Any LLM** | Inject `AGENTS.md` plus the relevant `SKILL.md` as system instructions |

---
